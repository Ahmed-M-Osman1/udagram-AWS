In this project I was provided with a developed Full-Stack application built for a retailer and deploy it to a cloud service provider so that it is available to customers. 

I used AWS console to start and configure the services the application needs such as a database to store product information and a web server allowing the site to be discovered by potential customers. Package.json scripts were modified and replace hard coded secrets with environment variables in your code.

I have register for a free account on CircleCi and connect my Github account to it. Based on the manual steps used to deploy the app, I did write a config.yml file that will make the process reproducible in CircleCi. I also set up the process to be executed automatically based when code is pushed on the main Github branch.
